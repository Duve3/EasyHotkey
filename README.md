# SimpleHotkey (Formerly EasyHotkey)
### A program similar to AutoHotkey (AHK) but made simpler and easier.
Simple Hotkey is designed to be simpler for beginners to start. With the disadvantage of being less 
powerful than AHK. Currently, SHK (Simple Hotkey) scripts cannot be translated into AHK scripts, but I hope
to provide this feature when it is fully released (out of beta/alpha). Also, I will not be providing
support for converting AHK scripts to SHK due to the fact that they are way more complex than an SHK script
and have features that (for simplicity reasons) SHK will never have.

### All the features that I want to add:

- a GUI interface (on map for alpha 0.1.0)
- a way to convert SHK scripts to AHK scripts (on map for official release v1.0.0â€”no longer in alpha/beta stage)
- obviously, adding more to SHK scripts such as mouse movement and more (on map for somewhere from alpha 0.1.0 to official release v1.0.0)
- \+ anything you the user want to add, just put a feature request in the issues tab.
